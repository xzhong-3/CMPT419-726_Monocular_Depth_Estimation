These codes are attempts to reproduce monocular depth estimation from the paper "Unsupervised CNN for Single View Depth Estimation: Geometry to the Rescue" by Ravi Garg et al. The "Coarse_L7.py" model is first trained for 5 epochs on 11600 images from the KITTI dataset. The weights trained from "Coarse_L7.py" are then saved and used to train "L8.model.py" for another 5 epochs on 11600 images from the KITTI dataset. The same step is repeated for "L9.model.py". The predicted disparity (inverse depth) from "L9.model.py" is rescaled to the size of the origninal input left image for comparsion, seen in the report. The "L9_validation_error.py" is the validation error function called in "L9_model.py" to compute the validation error on a separate data set every 50 iterations of weight updates.
